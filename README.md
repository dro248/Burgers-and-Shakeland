Burgers and Shakeland is a young, thriving restaurant. With a few different locations around town, they have brought you on to analyze their sales data and see if there are some business insights they can gain from their data.


## Questions:
- 1. What is the most popular item at Burgers and Shakeland?
- 2. Which location is the busiest? Does the answer to this question change throughout the day?
- 3. A combo meal consists of 1 Burger, 1 Fry, and either a drink or a shake (not both). How many Combo meals were sold from the State Street location in April?
- 4. Some of the employees have been complaining about working long hours. Based only on the transaction data, can you tell if any employees are working more than a typical 8-hour shift?


## (WIP) Additional questions:
- Finances: 
  - revenue, expenses, & profit (daily, per location, ...)
- Staffing: Can this be optimized? Raises? Bonuses?
- Marketing: 

What are the most popular items at each location?
- Burgers and Shakeland would like to run a 10% sale on Combo meals over the next month. If sales are consistent with last month, how much revenue should they expect to lose over the month?
